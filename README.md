### 📝 About me:
I am a novice web developer<img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/WUlplcMpOCEmTGBtBW/giphy.gif" width="30px">. My training lasts about **1.5 years and continues every day.** I started my training with a simple book for beginners in programming about the basics of web development. Then I took various courses and intensive courses, where I studied the basics of **C++, Java, HTML, CSS, Javascript.** In the process of gaining practical skills, my interest in web development was determined. I like to observe the visual result of the development, adjust and do better. I have a creative approach, a sense of taste and style, I tend to perfectionism.
